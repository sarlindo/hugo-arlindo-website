      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a curious person who loves tinkering with many things, whether it be new I.T technologies, taking apart my bike or home renovations for the simple fact that I enjoy understanding how things work. I am also a father of 2 kids, which means my free time is spent being a chauffeur. However, when I am not tinkering, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, traveling, working out, biking, comedy, music and playing poker.</description>
