I'm a curious person who loves tinkering with many things, whether it be new I.T technologies, taking apart my bike or home renovations for the simple fact that I enjoy understanding how things work. I am also a father of 2 kids, which means my free time is pretty limited, however when I am not tinkering, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, traveling, working out, biking, comedy, music and playing poker.

I currently work as a DevOps Engineer improving the software delivery life cycle through automation, building CI/CD pipelines and writing infrastructure as code.
